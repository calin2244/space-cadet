# space-cadet

A space invaders inspired game I'm working on

The sprites I've used are taken from the Unity Asset Store and some of them are drawn by me in Aseprite.

The game is a work in progress as there are a lot of things that have to be added(such as menus, power ups, procedural generated obstacles, different enemies)
